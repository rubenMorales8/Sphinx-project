Reports
-------

- The reports are only needed for the exercises.
- Reports **should not** be a 1:1 copy of the instructions, but instead be a summary of what you did 
  in a way that could be understood by someone else.
- It should highlight what you learned and/or problems that you might have encountered, 
  and how you resolved them.
- **Each configuration file that was created or modified by you needs to be committed to your GitHub repository.** 
  You donâ€™t need to store each version, just the final version after **each exercise**.

.. warning::
   
   Reports that are submitted with no files will automatically have **0 points**.

.. note::

   The reports have a dual purpose. On the one hand, they help us assess if you have successfully 
   completed the exercise. On the other side, it helps you as you move along, since each exercise 
   builds on the results of the previous one.
