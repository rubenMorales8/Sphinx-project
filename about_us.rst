Fernando Posada
------
HPC Engineer in the Systems Acceptance and User Environment group at the National Center for Computational Sciences in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). He earned his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. During his doctoral studies, Fernando developed an interest in High-Performance Computing and completed a Master’s degree in the same field from the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in collaboration with the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP).

Since then, he has been involved in various HPC projects, working on designing, deploying, managing, and providing support to users in different HPC resources. Before joining ORNL, Fernando worked for six years at Temple University, where he supported and promoted research on on-premises HPC resources and national supercomputing centers through XSEDE.

Richard Berger
------
Scientist 3 at Los Alamos National Laboratory. His background is in software engineering and optimizing high-performance computing codes, in addition to his degrees in Mechatronics. He is one of the core developers of the open source molecular dynamics code LAMMPS and has contributed to other open source projects such as LIGGGHTS and OpenKIM.

He played an essential role in the procurement, building, and installation of multiple HPC resources on Temple. This includes the Owl’s Nest HPC cluster, which now provides about 6500 CPU cores to the Temple research community.
