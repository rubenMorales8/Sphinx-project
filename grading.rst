Grading
=======

All participants will be assigned a group number. Each participant is required to keep notes of their 
progress along the exercises and summarize them in their own words by the end of the day in a **short written report**.
This report has to be submitted in their GitHub fork of the `course repository <https://github.com/example/repo>`_.

The final grade will be **40% based on the submitted reports**, **30% on the successful completion of exercises**, 
and **30% on the small quizzes throughout the course**.

.. warning::
   
   **Start taking notes immediately!** You have to be able to summarize what you did in your own words!  
   Past yearâ€™s best students started on their reports while they were working on the exercises.  
   That way the amount of work needed afterward becomes minimal.
