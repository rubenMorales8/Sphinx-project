Welcome to the High-Performance Computing Technologies Course
=============================
This is a two-week course introducing the basics of building, configuring, 
and operating High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. 
The goal of this course is to give students a solid foundation for 
understanding the components of a cluster, how they are typically configured, 
and what challenges operating such a machine entails.

Over these two weeks, students will learn how to set up their own clusters 
from scratch. We will use modern techniques of configuration management 
and show how to use Ansible to simplify repetitive tasks.

A central component of a cluster is its job scheduling system and modules. 
Students will learn how to manage software on multiple nodes using software modules, 
and configure essential software components for massively parallel applications.

The course will conclude by showcasing and discussing real deployments.
